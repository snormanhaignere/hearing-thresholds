Adaptive procedure for measuring hearing thresholds for pure tones. 
Two-interval alternative forced choice paradigm. A tone is played
in one of two intervals on each trial and subjects indicate which
interval had the tone. 3-up, 1-down adaptive procedure used to track
%80-point of psychometric curve. Step size are initially set to 5 dB.
After 4-reversals they are reduced to step-sizes of 1 dB, and another
6-reversals are measured.
